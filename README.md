Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch) 
</div>
This repository contains the code and resources for building a large language model (LLM) from scratch, as guided by Sebastian Raschka's book "Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)." This project aims to demystify the process of creating, training, and fine-tuning LLMs, providing a hands-on approach to understanding the underlying mechanics of these powerful AI models. By following the steps in this repository, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of LLMs and develop your own functional model.


## Chapter 1: Introduction to Large Language Models
*Abstract:*

Chapter 1 of "Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)" introduces the foundational concepts of large language models (LLMs). It begins by providing a high-level overview of LLMs, their significance in modern AI, and the transformative impact they have had on various applications, such as natural language processing, machine translation, and conversational agents.

The chapter explains the motivation behind creating LLMs from scratch, emphasizing the importance of understanding their inner workings to leverage their full potential. It outlines the scope of the book, detailing the step-by-step approach that will be used to build a functional LLM. 

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, moving beyond rule-based systems to deep learning-driven methods. LLMs are typically trained in two stages: pretraining on a vast corpus of unlabeled text to predict the next word and fine-tuning on a smaller, labeled dataset for specific tasks. These models are built on the transformer architecture, which uses attention mechanisms to process input sequences. While LLMs like GPT-3 focus on text generation, they also exhibit emergent capabilities like classification and summarization. Fine-tuning LLMs enhances their performance on specialized tasks.

By the end of Chapter 1, readers will have a clear understanding of what LLMs are, why they are important, and what to expect as they progress through the book. This introductory chapter sets a solid foundation for the hands-on journey of building a large language model from the ground up.
