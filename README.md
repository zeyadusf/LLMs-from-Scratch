Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch) 
</div>
This repository contains the code and resources for building a large language model (LLM) from scratch, as guided by Sebastian Raschka's book "Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)." This project aims to demystify the process of creating, training, and fine-tuning LLMs, providing a hands-on approach to understanding the underlying mechanics of these powerful AI models. By following the steps in this repository, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of LLMs and develop your own functional model.


## Chapter 1: Introduction to Large Language Models
*Abstract:*

Chapter 1 of "Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)" introduces the foundational concepts of large language models (LLMs). It begins by providing a high-level overview of LLMs, their significance in modern AI, and the transformative impact they have had on various applications, such as natural language processing, machine translation, and conversational agents.

The chapter explains the motivation behind creating LLMs from scratch, emphasizing the importance of understanding their inner workings to leverage their full potential. It outlines the scope of the book, detailing the step-by-step approach that will be used to build a functional LLM. This includes planning the model architecture, preparing datasets, training the model, and fine-tuning it for specific tasks.

Key concepts such as tokenization, embeddings, and transformer architectures are introduced, setting the stage for deeper dives in subsequent chapters. The chapter also discusses the prerequisites for readers, suggesting a basic knowledge of Python and machine learning to follow along effectively.

By the end of Chapter 1, readers will have a clear understanding of what LLMs are, why they are important, and what to expect as they progress through the book. This introductory chapter sets a solid foundation for the hands-on journey of building a large language model from the ground up.

## Chapter 2: Understanding the Components of Large Language Models

*Abstract:*

Chapter 2 of "Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)" delves into the essential components that form the backbone of large language models (LLMs). This chapter breaks down the complex architecture of LLMs, providing a clear and detailed explanation of each component's role and function.

The chapter begins by introducing the concept of tokenization, a crucial preprocessing step where text data is converted into numerical tokens that the model can understand. It explains different tokenization techniques, including byte pair encoding (BPE) and WordPiece, and discusses their impact on model performance.

Next, the chapter explores embeddings, which are dense vector representations of tokens. It covers how embeddings are generated and their importance in capturing semantic information. The chapter also highlights popular embedding methods, such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and contextual embeddings used in transformers.

The core of Chapter 2 is an in-depth examination of the transformer architecture, the foundation of most modern LLMs. It breaks down the transformer into its key components: the encoder, decoder, self-attention mechanism, and feed-forward neural networks. The chapter provides detailed diagrams and explanations of how these components work together to process and generate text.

In addition to the architecture, the chapter discusses the training process, including the objective functions used to optimize the model, such as masked language modeling (MLM) and causal language modeling (CLM). It also introduces transfer learning and the concept of fine-tuning pre-trained models on specific tasks.

By the end of Chapter 2, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the building blocks of LLMs. They will be equipped with the knowledge needed to implement these components and understand their interactions, setting the stage for practical model building and training in subsequent chapters.
