# LLMs from Scratch

Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch) 
</div>
This repository contains the code and resources for building a large language model (LLM) from scratch, as guided by Sebastian Raschka's book "Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)." This project aims to demystify the process of creating, training, and fine-tuning LLMs, providing a hands-on approach to understanding the underlying mechanics of these powerful AI models. By following the steps in this repository, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of LLMs and develop your own functional model.


## Chapter 1: Introduction to Large Language Models
*Abstract:*

Chapter 1 of "Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)" introduces the foundational concepts of large language models (LLMs). It begins by providing a high-level overview of LLMs, their significance in modern AI, and the transformative impact they have had on various applications, such as natural language processing, machine translation, and conversational agents.

The chapter explains the motivation behind creating LLMs from scratch, emphasizing the importance of understanding their inner workings to leverage their full potential. It outlines the scope of the book, detailing the step-by-step approach that will be used to build a functional LLM. This includes planning the model architecture, preparing datasets, training the model, and fine-tuning it for specific tasks.

Key concepts such as tokenization, embeddings, and transformer architectures are introduced, setting the stage for deeper dives in subsequent chapters. The chapter also discusses the prerequisites for readers, suggesting a basic knowledge of Python and machine learning to follow along effectively.

By the end of Chapter 1, readers will have a clear understanding of what LLMs are, why they are important, and what to expect as they progress through the book. This introductory chapter sets a solid foundation for the hands-on journey of building a large language model from the ground up.
